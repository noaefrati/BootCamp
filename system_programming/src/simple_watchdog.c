/*
	The  exec() family of functions replaces the current process image with a 
	new process image. The functions described in this manual page are 
	front-ends for execve(2). 
	(See the manual page for execve(2) for further details about the replacement
	of the current process image.)
    The initial argument for these functions is the name of a file that is
    to be executed.
    The functions can be grouped based on the letters following the
    "exec" prefix.
   
     v - execv(), execvp(), execvpe()
     The char *const argv[] argument is an array of pointers to null-terminated
     strings that represent the argument list available to the new program.
     The  first  argument,  by convention, should point to the filename 
     associated with the file being executed. 
     The array of pointers must be terminated by a null pointer.
     
      p - execlp(), execvp(), execvpe()
      These functions duplicate the actions of the shell in searching for an 
      executable file if the specified filename does not contain a slash (/) 
      character. The file is sought in the colon-separated list  of directory
      pathnames specified in the PATH environment variable.  If this variable
      isn't defined, the path list defaults to a list that includes the
      directories returned by confstr(_CS_PATH) (which typically returns the
      value "/bin:/usr/bin") and possibly also the current working directory;
      see NOTES for  further details.

      If the specified filename includes a slash character, then PATH is 
      ignored, and the file at the specified pathname is executed.

      In addition, certain errors are treated specially.

      If permission is denied for a file (the attempted execve(2) failed with 
      the error EACCES), these functions will continue searching the rest of the
      search path. If no other file is found, however, they will return with
      errno set to EACCES.

      If the header of a file isn't recognized (the attempted execve(2) failed
      with the error ENOEXEC), these functions will execute the shell (/bin/sh)
      with the path of the file as its first argument.  (If this attempt fails,
      no further searching is done.)

      All  other  exec()  functions  (which do not include 'p' in the suffix)
      take as their first argument a (relative or absolute) pathname that 
      identifies the program to be executed.
